        <summary>This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.</summary>
        <description>
This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits a network share (or visits a website that points to a network share) that contains a specially crafted file. However, in every case an attacker would be unable to force a user to visit such a network share or website.

Microsoft has released a Microsoft security advisory about this issue for IT professionals. The security advisory contains additional security-related information. To view the security advisory, visit the following Microsoft website: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2015/ms15-063

This update supersedes and includes an earlier update (KB2533623), which is no longer available for download, but remains a required update for .NET Core on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

On systems other than Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, this package installs successfully, but does nothing.
